#+TITLE: Lab 3. Multimodality

For this lab you have to do one of the two simple exercises.
1. "Click on the badger" game
2. Furhat integration
   
* 1. "Point at the badger"
In this exercise you will learn a bit more about how to interact with
the HTML page.

You need to design a game which helps user learn new words in a new
language. You are encouraged to do implement your game in languages
other than English.

The basic logic of the game is the following:
1. System tells user to point/click at one of the objects on the
   screen. See [[./examples/grid.html][example]] of UI (feel free to redesign it and change the
   objects).
2. User points/clicks at the object (e.g., the badger) on the screen.
3. System tells user whether they are right or wrong and either repeats the
   question or moves on to the next objects.

Advanced matters:
1. Use the power of xstate to send multimodal input to dialogue
   manager, but try not to use too many events and don't repeat
   yourself.
2. You can use xstate to implement "point-and-hold" so that user
   doesn't point at objects by mistake. Make use of [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseenter_event][mouseenter]] and
   timers to implement this.
3. Indicate visually whether the user is right or wrong. Note that
   they don't speak the language yet!
